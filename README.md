# Text-mining-of-employee-opinions

This project was done for the course Text and Network mining at HEC Montreal.
**The idea of the project was to analyze pros and cons of working in three different sectors represented by 14 companies:**

*	consulting - Big 4: EY, PwC, KPMG, Deloitte
*	telecommunication: Bell, Rogers, Telus, Videotron
*	banks:  Banque Nationale (National Bank), BMO, CIBC, RBC, Scotia Bank, TD

The data for this project - employees reviews of companies they work for - was collected on Glassdoor at the beginning of March 2020.
Whenever possible, 500 reviews per company, each containing pros and cons, were collected. In total, the dataset contains 6,431 reviews.

The data, code and results are coming soon!

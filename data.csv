My quitting time was supposed to be 4:30 but I never left before 5:15 at the absolute earliest. If the Partner is working through lunch, they will expect the same from you. Officially, you are allowed to claim overtime, but the managers put so many restrictions on claiming that it takes an extra hour of paperwork and even then there is no guarantee it will be approved. The pay is awful compared to similar companies and I received less to start than I did for a starting wage in an EA role over 10 years ago.",Consulting

Poor feedback mechanism. You might never see documented feedbacks by superiors. Risk of being backstabbed is high. They smile at you and comfort you - but you need to be mindful of the 'pot' before eating the food. 3. No work life balance. They say it but teams at times are short staffed or resources poorly allocated hence you spend your life on projects.  Remember point 2. 4.

Prepare to boring research, and build some very sub-par models.   2. Deloitte consulting has no team-like atmosphere that is indicative of other consulting firms.

And probably if you're an auditor, consultant or a partner the job and money is everything you've ever dreamt of. For an admin assistant/EA it's an ungrateful, soul destroying environment full of  repetitive data entry , constant calendar management and not much else. They work you to the bone, overtime is expected from you yet overtime pay requests are frowned upon.  Be prepared to be staying in the office until 7pm on a friday and catching up from home on weekends. You are assigned several partners to support, they don't notice you, you're a low end secretary to them. Furthermore when you start the job there is no training given and you're expected to learn everything immediately. Mistakes are not tolerated. Everyone is stressed. Office is full of robots staring in their laptops, nobody's chatting , laughing, you don't have time to make friends and as you sit at a different desk every day it's difficult to make friends. Majority of admin staff are tired, grumpy, overworked yet still convinced they are living the dream and really made it by being with Deloitte.   And all that for below average salary, benefits are actually not that good since things like drug coverage/dental require biweekly premiums or aren't covered 100% and there is no end of year bonus.

Deloitte,NA,- Looks Good on CV - Great new agile offices - Plenty of mobility opportunities If you know the right people - Reimbursement of studies,"- A lot of cuts as unrealistic targets were set for 2020. It's going to be grim moving forward. - The bonuses are calculated differently every year so that no one knows how they come up with the number. Basically, if Toronto had a bad year, the whole practice has a bad year. This is despite the fact that your team might have outperformed... doesn't matter. - Performance reviews are based on the whims of your partner. Each partner is the spokesperson for their team members. If your partner doesn't think much of you, you'll never get that promotion despite the fact that you do more than other people in other teams. Note: the whole performance review process was changed this year. Hopefully it gives everyone a fair chance. - Partners have NO say on your salary. It's decided by people who have never met you. So if you're a new higher, negotiate for a high salary! If not, they'll always keep you in the low ranges of your level and you can never negotiate once you're in. - Extremely long and tedious to change teams. - Best practices are NOT shared. Also, same teams in different offices will work differently and deliver different products for the same job! Extremely difficult to find templates (if there are any). - No IT service. They use Service Now and cut a lot of staff. When I left they were working on one month old tickets. There is NO service. - In some teams you're expecting to work until 6:30-7:00. It looks bad if you leave at 5:00. - Some teams are still very much a boys club. I was sometimes asked to ""fix"" a Power Point presentation because I was a girl and therefore must be good with visual presentations. It's hard to stand out or fit in if you don't have that cocky attitude which seems to impress many people in upper management.",Consulting

Deloitte,1,"- Good work/life balance compared to other locations due to the public sector focus - lots of bright people - friendly atmosphere, not competitive internally. The firm actively promotes inclusive values and you can actually see a lot of diversity (""visible minorities"" and women are well represented  at all levels of the organization). -  the organization is not as vertical as it seems. Partners are busy but are always available for a chat if required. - Not ""bossy"" but more collaborative - rarely idle, even when on the bench.  - New implemented performance system seems to make some sense (frequent informal check-points, no more year-end lengthy performance review to prepare but a 5-Q online form, meaningful rating system) - Agile work environment is great to develop network and to stay dynamic - Great system of ""Coach"" (i.e. Senior-level performance coach who is not managing you) and ""buddy"" (peer assigned to help you with everything from networking to answering your newbie ""how-to"" dummy questions) - lot of peer support. Even when not easy to obtain information on out-dated intranet, colleagues always have contacts who have contacts who can find you what you need and will usually be very responsive. - Great work atmosphere overall.  - HR is pretty much nonexistent (1 person is in charge of all ","ulting Ontario/East) but the firm is very supportive if you face personal issues. More than you would expect. - Deloitte University is a great toy that we are lucky to have and experience. - The firm is always trying to stay ahead of the game - The firm is great (in general) at managing clients and building relationships, not acting like so many consulting boutiques or firms by trying to sale just to sale (read: Change Request + staff aug) but aiming at selling by providing added value to the client. - Looks good on your resume and for good reasons. You will learn a lot and develop a great network.Cons- Everyone is expected to work on ""PRD"" activity (i.e. Sales and ""Firm development"" which means recruitment, on-boarding, internal projects, PoV). This model does not fit everyone and can create tensions. Promotions/raises/bonuses are officially not only based on your delivery results but also on ""how much you contributed to the firm growth"". - The consulting practice has been growing rapidly the last few years and the recruitment has had some holes (some new recruits are very strong but some are awfully week)  - on-boarding process for experience hires is so-so. - Coaching consistency should be enforced. A great coach or an uninterested coach can change a lot on your career path and rewards (but you can change easily) - There could be more satisfaction and less frustration but I dont believe there are many people who drag their feet to come to work, at any level. - All training is self-paced, on-demand, on-line. For basic mandatory live-training sessions could hugely benefit our delivery quality (power-point for dummies, how to interact with a client for dummies, how to design a process for dummies, how to sale work for d....everyone) - the mantra ""you build your own career"" is one the few promoted lines that is pure bs for 3/4 of the workforce. - Bonus are not bad but salaries tend to be on the low compared to competition despite stellar years for the consulting firm. - The firm tries a bit to be innovative but there are not really any good drivers for this.

EY,0,It is one of the Big 4 and a big brand name thats all.The worst work culture I have seen in Canada.,"I am a 31 year old woman who has worked at the Big 5 before.No words to describe the inhumane treatment I was subjected to.I was humiliated at work, belittled every day, mocked and discriminated in spite of giving my hundred percent at work. I worked from 8:30am-7:30 pm. Even the partners were impressed with my work. My associate director(manager) was the one who treated me in this inhumane manner.I was putting up with him, thinking I will apply for a transfer to another team within the organization. On the Monday, I performed my work as usual.The next day I was called by him into a meeting room with the HR seated inside. He said to me ""Your service is no longer required at EY"" in an absolute blunt manner! I was shocked to the core.I did not have the slightest idea. I had not done anything wrong, no misconduct, I had been toiling away and battling with whatever my manager threw at me and still came to work with a smile each day, only to be asked to vacate the office within 3 minutes.I was humiliated as I was asked to vacate immediately. They took charge of my work email id immediately and wanted to make sure I did not have any of the Partner appreciation emails with me. They disgraced me as a human. The manager put me through gender and racial abuse followed by this abrupt termination.He took the HR into confidence as well to perform this act.The HR is also said to be leaving soon. This man is a menace to society . He has no values ,cold blooded , racist, egoistic man who feels that no one can touch him because of his desgnation .I was told by my co-workers that I was the fourth person to be harrassed and fored this way and the management has been protecting him and allowing him to be part of this big and reputed organisation.Such people spoil the culture and brand name of EY",Consulting

The Managers did not care about the quality of our work, only producing as many billable hours as humanly possible.

At the EY Toronto office, it was quite a pleasant experience, with most people generally willing to help you out. The Partners and Senior Managers I worked with were kind, understanding, and willing to teach and mentor me. I really enjoyed my time with EY.   EY moves relatively fast for its size in terms of adopting new technology. Their knowledge management system is top-notch. If there is an area you want greater understanding of (like emerging technologies) or if you need a template for use in your engagement, the internal systems in place are an amazing place to start. You can truly tap into the power of the firm's global network for your research.","Advisory is broken out into the Performance Improvement (PI) and Risk. Risk primarily performs audit support work (IT risk, or financial risk management) and other risk-related engagements (internal audit, FRM). Audit support work, much like audit work, gets mundane and repetitive really quick; not to mention the unforgiving long hours it can take during ""busy seasons.""    If you are in Risk, there is little to no opportunity (although not impossible) to work on PI engagements as you go up the ladder (i.e. experienced Senior, Manager, and above). If you're in non-FRM Risk (i.e. ITRA and Internal Audit), I would encourage you to leave the firm, as there are much greener pastures elsewhere; even at the Senior Manager and Partner level.",Consulting

KPMG,0,"1. Good people to work with 2. Corporate events were fun 3. Work experience is valuable, but there is a limit. You will not gain more after 3 years, anything after is not transferable in any other career.","1. Low salary for high hours. Salaries consistently dropped over the years across the Greater Toronto Area while inflation rises. 2. Employee benefits are phased out (spun in a way that they are being improved to employees) 3. Performance favors long hour workers (70-120 weekly hours) 4. You cannot advance outside accounting or tax because you are provoked to work all of your free time. Sabbaticals and leave of absences are almost never approved, only granted to partners. You are expected to work just as many hours even when you have a Reduced workload in contract. 5.  Limited transfer opportunities - Management team (in a unit) have an incentive to keep you in their group. A transfer is the same as you quitting.  6. Limited opportunities within Public accounting, as mid size firms  require a broader spectrum of talent which the big four have disaggregated out to other functions. In industry, there is a breadth of skills that are not earned in the big four. 7. Partners are tied to a budget to meet their own salary/profitability goals. This is why there is never 'enough' staff and why employees have to work more than the worth of 2 individuals at any given time. 8. You will never enjoy the full scale of your benefit package as management has a right to not approve it to their benefit if it hurts their internal budget (which it always will).  9. KPMG has a high percent of breaches in audit practices. Management causes this by reducing engagement hours to low numbers to meet partners incentives which breaches auditor objectivity and independence in a sector that is supposed to add confidence to the financial markets.   10, The respect and knowledge a CPA had earned is often not performed in this firm due to their limitations imposed by management. Partners are scared to lose their clients and will do anything including breach independence and objectivity to keep them. 11.  Direct exposure in observing those at KPMG lie directly to government agencies. 12. Empty promises, numerous experiences having group agreed upon complaints brought to partners attention.

KPMG,NA,"Training was good on an overall level, such as for the Tax code and concepts.  Having the firm's name on your resume is absolutely required by some companies in and outside the industry for employment at higher, more senior levels.    Management has a very high technical competency.  Promotion is based almost exclusively on that particular factor (note mention of this in the ""Con"" section as well).  The number and level of benefits is high, as is generally common for the industry.","Training on basic applications, such as proprietary software, and industry-standard software used by the firm was essentially non-existent.  Managers generally have little or no interest in training new staff; the general attitude seems to be ""sink or swim.""    As noted in the ""Pros"" section, management is very technically competent.  Unfortunately, this is virtually the only factor considered or valued.  People skills, training skills, and basic general management skills are, at best, considered irrelevant; at worst, they are looked down upon. Due to the nature of the industry and the personality types which are most suited to the work (especially compliance work), it is quite unusual to have both the necessary technical competence and people skills in the same package.  Criticisms of work performance are frequently presented in hyperbolic terms, and can be startlingly personal in nature:  ""careless"", ""sloppy"", etc., are frequently and casually thrown around even when there are a small number of insignificant errors.     Accounting firms, especially Big Four firms, are known for a ""churn and burn"" culture:  departures are frequent and tenures are not normally more than a few years.  Due to a steady influx of young (and naive) students, there is very little impetus for change in the work culture.  As an example, KPMG just recently allowed employees to begin wearing jeans on ""casual Friday"", more than a few years behind the curve.",Consulting

Very results-oriented culture, whereby your efforts are not always recognized unless audit files have high recoverability rates.  Constant pressure to meat deadlines is at times unreasonable given unpreparedness of many clients for year-end audit and financial statement distribution.

These experiences alone were great.  However, KPMG is big enough, that if you don't want to travel, there are plenty of local jobs.","Auditing was not a rewarding job for me personally.  This is not a KPMG specific negative - it is more of a job specific negative.  Basically, regardless of how well you build relationships with clients, they are always happy to see you leave at the end of the audit.  I didn't enjoy that part of the job.",Consulting

On the other hand, good first impressions tend to last longer (than it should).  * Pay is also an area that KPMG can definitely improve on - it is probably one of the lowest among the big 4 group itself (and big 4 salary standard is not exactly high to begin with!) * Some groups are too top-heavy (3 to 1 Senior Management to Staff Ratio!!!) * As you move up to the top, you're expected to 'sell' more and more of KPMG's services.",Consulting

The first is the hours, which can sometimes be brutal during the first 3-4 months of the year (busy season).

Yet when it comes time to payouts they pick and chose who gets a bonus and who doesn’t even though your all the same rating and when you tell them for almost a year about your goals etc and what you need they just do nothing about it.

They would hire external employees instead of promoting good employees internally.  I don't think the firm knows how to increase employee morale and it could be very disorganized. Lots of red tape that prevent good business decision-making. They give out a chocolate bar to some employees who worked the most overtime in the previous week, while another Big 4 provides unlimited snack throughout the day. Really?

All the partners and managers complain about budget constraints yet they always seem to find a way to increase their own salaries and bonuses or perks while salary cuts take place for lower level employees. 4.Junior staffs tend to be looked down and it is expected to be the norm. 5.Politics dominates promotions, bonuses, and corporate hierarchy. 6.

They say they have work-life balance mechanisms, but your career will go nowhere if you take them up on it.

PwC,1,"Great staff. Super location close to TTC, GO Train, Lakeshore, Gardiner. Beautiful high tech office space.

PwC,0,The social culture is fantastic and is equivalent to that of a Tech company in SOME respects along with the fact that you will work with relatively intelligent and A personality people.  Training is above average and they provide you with tools to succeed in your exams at least in the past.  Not sure about the new CPA program as all the new employees will be guinea pigs for the program.  It provides a great brand name recognition on your resume and thus is an easy transition into industry.  Also there are solid opportunities to transition into a ,"ulting or Tax however YOU must seek it out as they won't actively promote Xlos transfers.  The firm really teaches you to work hard, be pro active and problem solve on the fly.    If you are good with maneuvering politics you can get ahead quite easily, thus being good at being cut throat will help your career and offer you some financial incentives.  Generally the Pay raises from year to year for the first 3-4 years are good as long as you are not held back from a relatively.  If you want to be challenged there is a great opportunity to do well and do many different things if you like.  There are really good international opportunities that offer some solid financial incentives to work in different countries and allow you to expand your experience base.ConsAlthough the firm promotes work-life balance they do not actively promote any of the ""Worklife"" policies they have set into play.  These policies are set in play generally to meet Top employer criteria for annual awards.  In general it is shunned to take advantage of the work life balance policies IN BUSY SEASON.  Thus these policies are just a political and face saving stunt that they try to pull on employees.  Depending on your situation you may end up doing work that is not in your interest or tedious or both.  Its really a roll of the dice sometimes with these situations to start especially if your mentor/coach doesn't care much about actually seeing you progress.  As this firm is quite cut throat at the upper echelons you coach may just see you as a placeholder in his/her career.  Management plays these games where they ask the staff for honest advice however the honest advice is never implemented.  The reason is the simple answer to all of PWC's problems or any big 4 is to pay staff more for their work however this would mean partners would have to take a pay cut.  Of which none of them want because the only reason they became partners is because of the money (not all but generally).  So you ask yourself why would they want to share?  Recently (within the past 2 years) they reduced the paygrid for associates-seniors because the partners decided they needed to maintain their pay.  Thus instead of the partners taking a pay cut for not doing their jobs properly and getting enough business they have cut the pay of lower level staff.  Additionally when staff inquire about small cost of living raises (2%) they are told on the compensation call that these are built in the raises.  However the raises are due to being promoted to the next level each year not because there is a COLA built in.  This is the type of nonsense they speak to their employees expecting people not to understand.  It is ironic that they want to hire the best of the best yet treat us like children to try to save Face from the realities.  Favoritism is rampant in the firm,  There is only a set allocation of high performance raises they give to employees and thus even if your performance is up to par with a ""high performance employee"" if you are not part of the favorite group you may just receive the ""average"" employee raise.  This obviously causes turmoil as certain hard working employees are left out of the sand box based on political favoritism.  They have started to hire Contract Seniors to save on cashflow and money to manager associates during busy season.  This is part of their cost reduction plan to maintain earnings and half due to the fact that none of the seniors are staying for manager because the sentiment is that its not worth it in the long run.  This on the inside doesn't look too well when management is blatantly replacing employees with temporary workers.  This doesn't exactly show loyalty to their hardworking lower level staff members.  Additionally, many people that do leave are unhappy due to the fact that management loves to make short term promises to get jobs done but cannot follow through with many of them.  This leads to resentment and additional departures that are just bad business as these former employees are set to become the controllers and CFO's of the future.  Many of the former benefits and perks are being scaled back such as free lunches at training sessions and rookie events are being cost cut just so the partners can ""maintain"" their earnings.  It's a never ending spiral of greed and incompetence that drives upper management to make decisions that only help themselves.    There is this mundane function of recording hours on jobs to manage WIP and recovery however there tends to be pressure to eat hours and under record the time worked.  If you record too many hours then you are just being INEFFICIENT not that the job is understaffed or poorly managed or the fee is too low.  The trouble PWC Assurance is finding is they are in the middle of a transition of generations and less and less staff are willing to sacrifice their lifestyles for a company that has clearly shown a lack of interest or investment in their own staff.  These Big 4 just ain't loyal no more.",Consulting

PwC,0,My Opinions:   - Career development fast track - Compensation increases are frequent - Great way to meet many different people at different organizations,"My opinions:  - Inexperienced middle management with (for the most part) no interest in adhering to firm policy. The only thing that matters is getting the job done.  - Management need to increase budgets for increased pressure by financial regulators. Ie: don't expect more quality work in a file if you aren't going to allocate the time to it in the budgeting process. - For a world wide professional services firm, I expected more professionalism from junior and senior staff alike. This is like being in high school! There are frequent inter-office ""scandals"" and politics play a tremendous role in promotions.  - Internal processes seem bureaucratic and needlessly painful. It is common to spend 30 minutes or more each day coding your time. Laptops are outdated and often can take 10 minutes to boot up.",Consulting

I only had online and shadowing training and was able to learn what was required of a support expert at the store. Then the manager, which is a guy who screams with young female employees because they were 3 minutes late, started to ask me about sales consultant expertise, he wanted me to do both roles: support expert and sales consultant.

Bell,0,Large company that is recognizable on your resume.   Benefits are really good because they have the buying power of such a large company. Great value for what is deducted from your pay cheque.  Full time employees have a pension offered. Employee matching for investments.  Location downtown Toronto is very central. Good food options nearby. Close to subway station.  Hours are generally 9 to 5 (give or take depending on if you're on a specific show). Unless your position is more demanding or administrative.,"Regular layoffs literally twice a year - often right before Christmas. The company is all about profit and completely ruthless when it comes to this.   Terrible overall company culture. If you're in the Toronto building, most people eat lunch at their desks because there isn't very much space elsewhere (aside from the commissary) to eat or take a break with co workers.  Culture of Fear. Everyone is afraid of losing their jobs, and as a result too afraid to speak up for change.  Very difficult to advance your career at this company. There are only a few management positions available, and it appears that if certain people are slated for leadership, you will have absolutely no chance. People stay in the same roles for years, both senior and junior.   Somewhat creepy security guard that adds all the women that work there on social media and likes/comments on their stuff, films behind the scenes on all the shows, takes pics with guests (which we're not really supposed to do).   Lack of diversity in ALL senior leadership across the entire company - all senior roles held by older white men. White women hold some senior roles. ZERO people of colour in roles other than in junior positions. Very few LGBTQ+'s in senior roles too, minus a few tokens. All they do to hit their numbers is hire entry level diversity hires...and then let them go on the next round of layoffs... It's incredible that they still manage to win diversity and inclusion awards.   The town halls are a joke. It's very clear that the questions employees are asking are being filtered through the communications department so that the President only answers things that will make him and the company look good. It's essentially an internal press conference more than anything. They don't care about what employees have to say because at the end of the day they want to put on rose coloured glasses and avoid any of the issues at hand.   Pay is below industry standard. Biggest advice to those applying is to negotiate hard when you are applying, because unless your position is unionized - it's near impossible to get a raise down the road.  Historical drama between CHUM staff and CTV staff, linked to their grandfathered union rates. The company will try to go through every loophole possible to avoid paying people more (i.e. making people ""managers"" so they can't be union and can exploit the amount of hours they have to work).   Also a lot of their processes are outdated and inefficient. They still use office 2010. They still do manual hand written time sheets. No one ever knows how much vacation time they have left etc.   Work/Life balance could be better.",Telecom

It seems that Toronto managers have more power so if you work in Montreal and finished a prototype/product, Toronto managers can decide to throw it like garbage because it wasn't developed in Toronto. Bell can have 2 managers in both location for the same field. In that case, it's always strike back and forth between them because Montreal can't take any credit for any developments.  - No vision: One of the mains reasons I left it's because they don't have a vision.

Management lied about the ability to move up by providing false promises at the beginning of the year and repeatedly retracting around mid year and final reviews. There are a few longtime people who are known aggressors and known to harass women, and despite many reports about the bullying behaviour or lewd comments, you would find these people still working there holding high positions and if you dare stand up to them, you are scolded for not being malleable, and lacking communication skills. Their behaviour is never reprimanded by HR or directors, so people just keep leaving. You will be overworked , severely under appreciated and underpaid. Especially if you are part of the GLP program.

Staff remain in the office overnight on a semi-regular basis to complete projects due, again, to the extraordinary dysfunction of the department and the overwhelming incompetence of the management.  Naturally, the turnover rate is comically high. A minority of the department remain beyond the three month mark, and those who do stay for lack of alternative, adding to the total chaos.  You will learn absolutely nothing in this department, as the actual work done by junior staff is totally menial. For the ""creative"" department, you will spend most of your time producing content for an utterly pointless internal ""exhibition."" It is impossible to explain how pointless this is.

Rogers,1,"I have been at Rogers for 19 years - 21 if you count the two years I worked part time.  Prior to joining the Rogers team I changed jobs every 2 to 3 years because I never felt I had found the right employer.  After working part time for a year I took on a full time position elsewhere (benefits of being full time were too much to resist).  Approximately a year into working for a different employer, my previous Rogers manager called to ask how much I liked my new job because she had a full time opportunity.  We met to discuss the roll and I never looked back.  19 years later I still feel I have found the right employer and I still love my job.  The pros would be 1.  My colleagues are more like family 2.  My opinions are valued 3.  Most of the people on my team have been with Rogers 15+ years (this says a lot) 4.  Sense of community and giving back to the community 5.

Depending on your position, there is quite a bit of flexibility in work/life balance, but most people being salaried there's always some pressure to just get things done. Like most large companies, there are large-scale re-orgs every few years, which gives management opportunity to shuffle out people who should not be there, as it's normally quite hard to fire someone for poor performance. High level presentations of future technology and product direction and strategy gives a good level of confidence in the overall business and upper management competence.","Performance bonuses, and the entire ""performance management"" system is needlessly complicated, and makes it basically impossible to get small, semi-regular pay increases to cover cost of living escalations, as it is against current long-standing management policy of ""small raises are not appreciated"", a BS excuse if there ever was one.

RBC,0,Stable salary. Otherwise benefits are below standard and getting worse and worse by the year.,"1. RBC is mass hiring in the Greater Toronto Area. That's saying something about this job position and the turnover rate. Which is super high.  2. They will keep you as an intern until a branch wants you. So basically you are expected to be moved anywhere and everywhere they deem that need you.  3.  You do exactly the same things as a full fledged Banking Advisor. Only reason they leave the intern title on you is because they hold the right to terminate you any time they want without repercussions.  4. Sales targets keep growing and growing. Target for future is bringing in more and more clients.   5. Not really about helping customers, it's all about how much you can sell, even if the customers don't need it. (Cross selling is illegal but that doesn't stop multi product rebate!)  6. Really shady practices such as not telling customers sufficient information about insurance etc and once customers start using the products the insurance fee shows.   7. Job advertisement is not truthful. You will be a part time teller sometimes even full time depending on community needs. (But you are still expected to hit sales targets for the week.)  8.  Managers only see you for the numbers you churn out. Weekly goal settings to go over how much you sold and why you aren't selling enough, 'Insuring"" customers enough.   9. Perverse psychological teachings on how to ""hunt"" the customers to make them buy unneeded products even if they aren't in a great financial position.   10. No growth after a few years. Most of my coworkers left and went to TD/CIBC/Scotia because RBC would not approve of the role change. (Not to mention instantly slapping on a BIG sign on bonus and a GENEROUS salary increase).  11.  Constantly preaches about relationship banking but honestly most of the newer coworkers have not stayed for more than 2 years.  12. Older generation is just waiting to retire, they don't really care at all. Seniority runs deep. The longer you've worked here the lesser they listen to management. I.E. 25 years teller, takes 3-4 customers a day cause they waiting to retire and manager knows it but is powerless so you're stuck helping hundreds of customers.  13. Depending on branch some days you will be understaffed and won't be able to take your full hour of lunch break. I.E you eat for 15 min that's pretty much it, cause customers.  14. Gets paid way too little to deal with all the fraud and paperwork. They expect you to do everything from teller to opening accounts to selling mutual funds to pushing paper work to meeting sales target.",Banks

I found this to be a big lie. During my time at td, i often found senior management pressuring staff to make unethical selling decisions. An example of this was to tell a customer who perpetually lived in overdraft to open up a tfsa and set up a preauthorized transfer to it so ""they can save money"". Which basically means they may overdraft interest on their savings.  - managers do not care about their staff, only what numbers they can bring in.  - td makes higher and higher profits each year but branch staff are getting smaller bonuses.

The minimum hours a week you can work is 22.5 period, and depending on how you select your availability hours, this could be broken up into 5 little shifts which is very, very frustrating when you have to commute.

It was nice for a few years or so, but not anymore.  - They completely ran out of the office space. Heard the CEO talking about 350 people at Digital Factory on TV? That's how it was designed to be. And now double that number. There's 2 categories of people - those who joined DF early and claimed their seats/desks and new joiners who don't have that ""luxury"". You would think that having a desk and at least one extra screen for a developer (or any role, really) is the least employers can do, but none of the new joiners get that. If you join now you will end up working from a cafeteria or just sitting in the hallway with a laptop on your knees hurting your back while being surrounded by a bunch of people as if you are sitting in the middle of the St. Lawrence market on Sunday. To be fair if you work there long enough to see somebody from your team leave - you can try to claim ""dead man's"" seat. Nice, eh. - Very noisy environment. Which is caused by the overpopulation of the space. It's impossible to book a meeting room and people are forced to have ""meetings"" right at their desks. - They completely banned GitHub in the whole bank not realizing that the world runs on the back of the Open Source software. If you actively deal with Open Source tech - try to code for a day without being able even to browse GitHub and see how it goes for you. But then the management said that we had to compete with the Big Tech who's running full speed into the banking space. See the problem here? - Their food is some cheap processed junk 50% of the time.

The work schedules were very unfavourable. You’d work weird hours like 11-2pm sometimes or 1-5pm.  So it’s hard to get another part time job as the work hours are awkward. It’s also hard to get more work hours as that’s one of the company’s focus on cutting. They try to run lean on staff and it can be really stressful if you’re working at a busy branch. Due to those reasons and more, there’s always a high turnover. Then again it’s more of an entry level temp job.",Banks

Training period itself is 2 months with 1 month in class and 1 month on floor taking calls. I felt that the amount of work you were doing did not equal to pay. They put this euphoria in your head that this job is great and you can expect to move up (when its really not like that). Career growth in these positions is lateral with around a $1000 increase in pay. Be prepared to take a lot of constructive criticism from your managers because especially if it does take you longer to get the hang of the job.  My final point is expectation. They base your performance too heavily on your scorecard which consists of customer reviews and average handle time (the amount of time it takes for you speak to customers on the phone).

BMO,0,"-Health/Dental Plan options. Easy to use and convenient online access.  -Employee banking  no monthly fees, 50% off your annual Mastercard fee.  -If you don't like your branch, there is often opportunity to help out at other locations and possibly transfer. However, managers can be possessive sometimes and refuse to let you go even if you and the other branch have consented. I suggest asking for it and taking action. Waiting won't do you any good.  -Same thing goes for switching departments. E.g. Retail banking to Private Banking or Nesbitt Burns -You meet a lot of people and work with different clientele when you help out at different branches. Expands your customer service experience.","I’m sorry, this will be a long one.   -Hiring managers were dishonest about job expectations during interview.   -Overtime is never paid but always expected. Even for hourly employees.   -Tellers &amp; Advisors are frequently shamed (directly or indirectly) for taking their full entitled breaks.   -Preach about service but extremely sales oriented.   -Advancement is often based on nepotism, especially for management positions.   -The work schedule is supposed to be out 2-4 weeks in advance but that is usually not the case. There were a few times when the manager posted the schedule on the Wednesday so nobody knew what time or if they were even working on Monday and Tuesday! Average in my experience with all branches I worked/helped out at was 0-2 weeks in advance. Sometimes they change it last min too.   -Managers will insult, accuse, shame and berate their staff to please customers. Safe to say they never stand up for their own and use that opportunity to lower employees' performance record. I have never witnessed so many employees crying on the job in any of my past workplaces.   -Only expect a raise when you are switching roles/getting promoted. Even then, don't expect much.   -In-branch awards such as Brilliant at the Basics means nothing. Doesn't even count as anything in your performance review. When you're no longer new you realize there is nothing exciting about it lol. I lost count of how many I've been awarded and quickly stopped feeling proud.   -BMO never pays for company or staff events. Management and staff are constantly pushed to attend events and often “teased” for not attending. (Staff events may be covered by Wealth Management department)  -Management, regardless of which branch, are extremely unprofessional and two-faced. There is a trend of incompetent branch and assistant branch managers. Any time they mess up an advisor's deal, they blame others and don't take ownership.  Super sweet and accommodating to clients, awful to staff, expect ""their employees"" to ""take ownership"" of unrealistic situations/promises management created.  They half-ass the training, assuming they do any, and want current staff to mentor the newbies even if they are also new.  Some BMs are exceptionally lazy and don't even now basic information and/or procedures. One of many reasons why majority of branches fail audit every year.  Some BMs have no clue what goes on in their branch. Even turned a blind eye to workplace bullying.   -Tellers can be heavily expected to perform ""lobby leadership"" duties, which is basically greeting people in a very scripted manner. Duties are dependent on branch. Script is heavily enforced.  Saying your own genuine greeting can be considered unacceptable and ineffective. Must say ""Welcome to BMO!"" in an appropriate upbeat manner at all times.   -BMO servers crash quite often. I've lost count of how many times we had to turn customers away or tell them to come back when everything is up and running again.   -Lots of negative gossip between staff members, branches, and markets. Branch Managers are always talking smack about each other but super fake and friendly in person. There is only ONE branch manager I've met in the Vancouver market who is genuine and respectable.   -HR department is not helpful at all.   -Vacation approval is not based on seniority or how much time in advance you request time off. Christmas is the hardest. I formally (written and verbally) requested half a year in advance and was rejected on the second week of December.   -Management give you tasks/news very last minute. You are the unprofessional one if you don't accommodate promptly.   -There is no trust at BMO. Some of my former coworkers were scared to even answer the annual ""confidential"" workplace survey honestly because they didn't want to get in trouble. Managers always seem wary of their staff and often accuse them of lying if they call out. A coworker was in a car accident and management expected that person to come back to work a 9-hr shift within 2 days despite back and neck injuries.  All of my direct coworkers and I were accused of lying when calling out sick. There was no history of staff lying about such things. No compassion was shown when a family member of an employee died.   Note: I’m not saying I didn’t gain any skills/knowledge while working here. Unfortunately, BMO is not a healthy work environment. Find something different to place your loyalty. Also, keep track of your own stuff! Management will try to turn things against you/blatantly lie so I encourage you to keep everything in writing (email).   Or, final suggestion: Don’t work at BMO.   I sincerely hope this helped.",Banks

He had us delivering a thing of elegant but straightforward design, utility and effectiveness.    A change in senior management led to his departure.  He was replaced by a pair of ego-driven newbies with little no financial industry experience, who have no concept of the controls and regulations required to keep the banks reputation and customer assets safe.     Instead, their lack of vision and a lack of a well-thought-out cohesive road-map for the way forward has left in its wake a road littered with abandoned technology, broken infrastructure, and highly dis-satisfied internal customers, as leadership constantly chases and attempts to implement the next Bright Shiny (technological) Object.     For a brief moment in time - about 5 months - we had someone appointed who looked like he was going to help us move away from the chaos of the Keystone Cops, or at least put some rigour in place.  Unfortunately,  5 months was all it took for him to realize that it was a lost cause, as more seasoned technology pros surround us like vultures looking to pick apart what's left, as the Newbies are losing their credibility.",Banks

To give you an idea, the minimum wage in BC just recently (2018) went up to $12.65/hr, so I was almost (if you don't count the benefits, which aren't as significant as they pump them up to be) being paid less than minimum wage. It's no wonder that people in the city stay servers and bartenders into their late twenties with wages like that it would probably take you 4 or 5 years at the Bank before your hourly rate matched that of a Cactus Club server. The CSR position, and even FSM position, are pretty much positions that would be suitable for finance/commerce undergrads to cut their teeth (just a bit) in finance. They are not suitable for adults who have to buy things and live. Finally, if you are going to work in sales here, if your numbers aren't really good - just quit, because your career is over and you mean nothing.

NationalBank,1,"Best pay on the street by far. Not even close to the other Big banks. The compensation info on here is very misleading.  Corporate banking analysts make about $150k all-in and corporate banking associates make over $200k. National is one of the big 6 ""too big to fail"" banks in Canada so you're involved in the biggest capital market transactions. Being the smallest of the big 6, national isnt plagued by beaurocracy the way the other big banks are. Teams are also a lot leaner so juniors are given way bigger responsibilities than at the other banks. People learn very fast here. The bank's teams are really rolling right now and have snatched some of the best talent on the street. Very intelligent, polished juniors and very experienced, connected seniors. Very hungry culture. Management is very approachable.","National is the biggest in Quebec and has all the biggest clients in that market. Although super successful on Bay street, sometimes it feels like the Quebec success stories overshadow all the huge wins in Toronto. Toronto could use more recognition from senior management. Not sure if Quebec is paid as good as Toronto but they definitely seem to get more pats on the back.   Corporate Banking hours are about 55-60 per week. This is more than the other big banks.",Banks

Another thing I like about this bank is the target (objectives) compare to other banks, are significantly smaller, and more achievable.

Sometimes it takes a long time to get one client's request done, or take many steps to finish the administration work.  Though overall I must say the staff benefits are great, but one thing I am not crazy about is that  new employee need to earn their vacation days for a year before full entitlement kick in. Why not pro-rate the vacation days from the very first year for new employees? The bank also has several silos, in combination with technology challenge, that can create client experience barrier.

NationalBank,0,national bank of canada is the biggest bank in Quebec and one of the top banks in Canada. So working there means that you are working for a recognized name. Being one of the biggest banks in the nations means that are clients are willing to make business with that bank. There is a lot of internal job openings so an employee can apply to different positions at all times which is a good potential for diversification and for a career change. Also there is a good and lengthy training period before starting the position which is really a plus.,the downsides for working for this bank is that there is so much bureaucracy so on the administrative side things that to be rather slow . Also management could be really far from the employees and feedback comes late or does not come at all. Also i felt a lot of discrimination based on national origin in this bank.,Banks

There are some that have zero leadership or coaching abilities, who employes under perform every year, but still manage to keep their jobs or even get promoted.  They tend to give promotions to workers who are not the top performers.  They seem to have the philosophy that giving a promotion to our top performers would cost the company too much in lost sales.  So most top performers like myself tend to leave the company after 3 to 4 years because we see no way up the ladder at the bank, and we are head hunted by other banks or the Caisse populaire.
